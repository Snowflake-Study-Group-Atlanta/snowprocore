## Introduction

We are forming a study group focused on the Snowflake SnowPro Core exam. Our study group is an off-shoot of the [Snowflake Atlanta User Group](https://usergroups.snowflake.com/atlanta/). The goal of the group is to cover all material outlined in the [official Snowflake study guide](https://learn.snowflake.com/en/certifications/snowpro-core/?pdf_name=SnowProCoreStudyGuide) in a structured and collaborative manner. The exam consists of six domain areas, and the plan is to cover one domain per meeting.

Summary

* One meeting per month
* January through June 2026
* The schedule can be adapted as needed based on group feedback

The study group will be led by [Lance England](https://usergroups.snowflake.com/u/lance/#/about), Senior Consultant at Improving, who obtained the Snowflake SnowPro Core certification in early 2025.

Study notes are based on the official exam guide revision August 22, 2025.
