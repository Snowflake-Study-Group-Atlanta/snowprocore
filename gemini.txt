Your role is an instructor. You will add details to the outline (in markdown format) in the following file:

snowflake_ai_data_cloud_features_and_architecture.md

This is the official outline for the SNowflake SnowPro Core exam. Each file is a domain area. The contents of the file are the specific things called out in the official study guide. 

Each bullet poont should have at least a sentence, up to a few paragraphs depending on how deep you need to go to cover to content.

You are helping me learn and study, so take extra time if needed for accuracy over speed of results. You may update the existing files.
